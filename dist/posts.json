Interesting.So, we just add a ; to the beginning of the module, and to the end. This acts as a safeguard to ensure we don’t run into that problem when we minify.So, when we try doing the above example with semicolons at the beginning and at the end, and you minify the code, you get this instead:The working code:;(function() {})();;(function() {})();The cool thing is, the above doesn’t throw any errors. In fact, JSHint won’t yell at you either.Why is this? Check out the MDN article on empty:  An empty statement is used to provide no statement, although the JavaScript syntax would expect one.So those extra semicolons are not a syntax error, because a random semicolon anywhere in the code can be interpreted as an empty statement. Cool, huh?",
